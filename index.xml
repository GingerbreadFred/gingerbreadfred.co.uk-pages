      <title>Day 6: Horn</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a couple of free hours this morning so I went to start the headlight assembly but realised I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the glue for the IVA trim. Unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s the first thing you need to do so I held off on that and installed the horns. This was quite an easy job, made slightly more complicated by the fact that I had already installed the steering rack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I then added some pipe lagging to the engine bay to protect the frame from the engine install and cut the IVA trim to size for the headlight assembly which I will be able to do as I now have glue!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this week has been quite hectic and I haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to get as much work done on the car as I had originally hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am getting the car wrapped next week so the bulk of the work has been removing the windscreen, the rear lights and lowering the washer motors clear of the scuttle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQDoEczy1jY?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&#xA;      &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By far the most fiddly part of the work was the washer motors. They are attached on the passenger side on a special mounting plate via two bolts. This is quite fiddly to get to but I managed to get there in the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The day has finally arrived!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got a call at 8:30 this morning from the delivery driver telling me that he was an hour a way. One thing that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting was that he asked me if we would have anyone to help as apparently unloading with 2 people is very difficult. I had a quick call around and managed to find a friend of mine who was able to duck out of work for an hour to help out (thanks Tel!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Delivery day is coming on Tuesday so I have been getting the final bits of garage prep done before the big day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been following a few blogs for the list of tools and consumables that I will need for the build. Given how little mechanaical work I have done in the past (change tyres / brake pads) I&amp;rsquo;m a little nervous that I don&amp;rsquo;t have the right tools, don&amp;rsquo;t have enough space, and don&amp;rsquo;t have the skills to build this car but that&amp;rsquo;s all part of the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
