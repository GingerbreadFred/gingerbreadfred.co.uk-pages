      <description>&lt;p&gt;The day has finally arrived!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got a call at 8:30 this morning from the delivery driver telling me that he was an hour a way. One thing that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting was that he asked me if we would have anyone to help as apparently unloading with 2 people is very difficult. I had a quick call around and managed to find a friend of mine who was able to duck out of work for an hour to help out (thanks Tel!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Delivery day is coming on Tuesday so I have been getting the final bits of garage prep done before the big day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been following a few blogs for the list of tools and consumables that I will need for the build. Given how little mechanaical work I have done in the past (change tyres / brake pads) I&amp;rsquo;m a little nervous that I don&amp;rsquo;t have the right tools, don&amp;rsquo;t have enough space, and don&amp;rsquo;t have the skills to build this car but that&amp;rsquo;s all part of the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
